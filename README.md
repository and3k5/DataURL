![DataURL](/res/Header.png)

## What it is
Drop any file to the page and you will get a data URL of the file.

[See the page in action!](http://and3k5.github.io/DataURL/)

### Im sorry, what?
A data URL is often used for images on a page without uploading multiple files.

A data URL of a html page could look something like this: 
```
data:text/html;base64,PGgxPldlbGNvbWUgdG8gbm93aGVyZTwvaDE+PHA+V2hlcmUgYW0gSSwgeW91IG1pZ2h0IGFzay48YnIgLz5XZWxsIEkgZG9uJ3Qga25vdyA6UDwvcD4=
```

Look up [Data URI Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) at Wikipedia
## Why make this?
I don't know.
